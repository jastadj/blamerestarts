This project is for a weekly game jame (weeklygamejam.com) on 3/9/18.

The prompt is "what's it do?".

This game randomizes all the input commands so the user must figure out what the keys do.
The concept is a Blaster Master-like hence the title "Blame Restarts" which is an anagram for "Blaster Master".
